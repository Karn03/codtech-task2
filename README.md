## House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

### Introduction
Predicting house prices accurately is crucial for real estate investors, buyers, and sellers. This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various factors.

### Project Overview
**Project Title:** House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
**Author:** **GODHA KARTHIKEYAN YADAV**
**Company:** **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS**
**ID:** CT12DS385
**Duration:** June to July (8 weeks)
**Mentor:** **G.SRAVANI**

Problem Statement
Accurately predicting house prices is a complex task influenced by numerous factors. This project seeks to build a linear regression model to estimate house prices based on relevant features.

 Methodology
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
   * Collect a dataset containing house prices and relevant features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location).
   * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and correlations.
   * Cleanse the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   * Feature engineering to create informative features.

2. Model Development:
   * Build a linear regression model using relevant features as predictors.
   * Train the model on the prepared dataset.
   * Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

3. Model Evaluation and Deployment:
   * Assess the model's performance on a holdout test set.
   * Analyze the model's coefficients to understand feature importance.
   * Consider deploying the model for real-time house price predictions.
